Ingredients:
 - 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
 - 1 lb boneless lamb shoulder or beef chuck roast, trimmed of fat and cut into 1-inch cubes
 - 2 medium onions, coarsely chopped
 - 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into thick strips or cubed
 - 1 eggplant, cut into small cubes
 - 3 large tomatoes, coarsely chopped
 - 2 medium green chilies
 - 2 medium boiling potatoes
 - salt and pepper, to taste
 - 1/2 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
 - 1/2 tsp black peppercorns
 - 3/4 tsp sweet Hungarian paprika
 - 1/2 tsp hot Hungarian paprika
 - 2 bay leaves
 - 5 to 6 cups lamb or beef stock
 - 2 cloves garlic, minced
 - 1 1/2 Tbsp red wine vinegar, or to taste
 - medium handful cilantro, chopped
 - small handful parsley, chopped
 - 1 box fettuccine noodles

Directions: 
 1. I would suggest preparing all of the vegetables before browning the meat.  This will streamline the process and have you done much sooner.  

 2.In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium high heat.  Add the meat when the oil begins to shimmer.  Brown well on all sides and remove to a bowl; 
   set aside for the moment.
